#Bibliomancy: an oblique strategy

This program creates a library of congress callnumber by adding to together randomly selected parts. 

It's to be used as an "oblique strategy" called Bibliomancy. Bibliomancy is the use of books in divination. Using this strategy, I intend to select a book from the shelves of the Leddy Library, randomly select a passage, then share this passage for reflection.

The first iteration of this program used a [Google Documents spreadsheet to select random numbers] (http://shorty.aedileworks.com/call-number-generator) that are used to look up elements and piece together a call number

This is a second iteration that is done in a similary embarassingly primitive way using Javascript. It's so rudimentary, it shames me.

My goal is to continually improve this program through various iterations to encourage myself to make many small programs and in doing so
demonstrate how a simple idea can be developed into something complex. 

At the moment, I'm thinking my third iteration will be written in PHP to make use of an SQL table that gives the precise number ranges that are associated with each LC Class as most of these don't go up to 9999. The long-term goal is to end up with a Drupal module and/or a twitterbot.
